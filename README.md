# üí´ About Me:
As a dedicated student of Electronics Engineering and a talented backend developer, I am passionate about designing, building, and maintaining the systems that power the applications and websites we use every day. I love working on the server-side of things, from designing APIs to writing optimized database queries. With my skills in programming languages like Python and SQL, as well as my experience with tools like Git and Docker, I am able to create efficient, scalable, and secure systems that meet the needs of users and businesses alike. For me, there is no greater satisfaction than seeing a complex system come together and perform flawlessly.
